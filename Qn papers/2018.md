(D) an uncountable set.
```

Solution: (B)

|Recursively enumerable|Recursive|

Which one of the following statements is FALSE?
(A) Context-free grammar can be used to specify both lexical and syntax rules.
(B) Type checking is done before parsing.
(C) High-level language programs can be translated to different Intermediate
Representations.
(D) Arguments to a function can be passed using the program stack.
```

Solution: (B)

Type checking is done at semantic analysis and parsing at syntax analysis. Syntax analysis comes before semantic.

The following are some events that occur after a device controller issues an interrupt while
process L is under execution.
(P) The processor pushes the process status of L onto the control stack.
(Q)The processor finishes the execution of the current instruction.
(R) The processor executes the interrupt service routine.
(S) The processor pops the process status of L from the control stack.
(T) The processor loads the new PC value based on the interrupt.
Which one of the following is the correct order in which the events above occur?
(A) QPTRS (B) PTRSQ (C) TRPQS (D) QTPRS
```

Solution: (A)

Remember: when interrupt occurs, first the processor finishes the current instruction.

Consider a process executing on an operating system that uses demand paging. The average
time for a memory access in the system is M units if the corresponding memory page is
available in memory, and D units if the memory access causes a page fault. It has been
experimentally measured that the average time taken for a memory access in the process is
X units.
Which one of the following is the correct expression for the page fault rate experienced by
the process?
(A) (D – M) / (X – M) (B) (X – M) / (D – M)
(C) (D – X) / (D – M) (D) (X – M) / (D – X)
```

Solution: (B)

MAT when no page fault = M

MAT when page fault = D

Total AMAT = X

page fault rate = ?

```
Total AMAT = Page fault rate * MAT when page fault + (1-page fault rate) * MAT when no page fault
```

Consider the following two tables and four queries in SQL.

Book (isbn, bname), Stock (isbn, copies)
Query 1: SELECT B.isbn, S.copies
FROM Book B INNER JOIN Stock S
ON B.isbn = S.isbn;
Query 2: SELECT B.isbn, S.copies
FROM Book B LEFT OUTER JOIN Stock S
ON B.isbn = S.isbn;
Query 3: SELECT B.isbn, S.copies
FROM Book B RIGHT OUTER JOIN Stock S
ON B.isbn = S.isbn;
Query 4: SELECT B.isbn, S.copies
FROM Book B FULL OUTER JOIN Stock S
ON B.isbn = S.isbn;
Which one of the queries above is certain to have an output that is a superset of the outputs
of the other three queries?
(A) Query 1 (B) Query 2 (C) Query 3 (D) Query 4
```

Solution: (D)

In SQL, Full outer join combines the result of both left and right outer joins and returns all rows of both sides of the table.

(iv) The cwnd approximately doubles every round trip time.
Which one of the following is correct?
(A) Only (ii) and (iii) are true (B) Only (i) and (iii) are true
(C) Only (iv) is true (D) Only (i) and (iv) are true
```

Solution: (C)

Two people, P and Q, decide to independently roll two identical dice, each with 6 faces,
numbered 1 to 6. The person with the lower number wins. In case of a tie, they roll the dice
repeatedly until there is no tie. Define a trial as a throw of the dice by P and Q. Assume that
all 6 numbers on each dice are equi-probable and that all trials are independent. The
probability (rounded to 3 decimal places) that one of them wins on the third trial is _____.
```

Solution: 0.023
```
condition for tie = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6)}
P(tie) = 6/36 =1/6(since 2 dice sample space is 36)
P(not tie) = 5/6

gn that one of them wins in third trial i.e., first 2 trials are tie and third is not tie

P(win) = P(tie)*P(tie)*P(not tie)

Solution: 3

- Chromatic number of graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
- The approach used here is independent sets that is incase of large complex graphs it is difficult to check for each vertex
- Independent set means a set containing vertices & each & every vertex of this set is independent to each other i.e. if there are 3 vertices in an independent set, then each vertex of this set does not connected to other vertex of this set by an edge.

Let G be a finite group on 84 elements. The size of a largest possible proper subgroup of G
is ________.
```

Solution: 42

- Group is said to be finite if it is a finite set
- Subgroup (H) is a non-void subset of group (G) which satifies the following conditions

    - the identity element a∈ H.
    - H is closed under the operation of G i.e. if a, b∈ H, then a, b∈ H and
    - H is closed under inverses, that is if a∈ H then a-1∈ H.

- order of group = number of elements in  group
- Order of subgroup always divides the order of group
- Proper subgroup = subgroup which is not trivial
- factors = 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,14,21,28,42,84
- since 1 and 84 are trivial, largest is 42

Consider a system with 3 processes that share 4 instances of the same resource type. Each
process can request a maximum of K instances. Resource instances can be requested and
released only one at a time. The largest value of K that will always avoid deadlock is ____.
```

Solution: 2

Deadlock-free condition is

```
R ≥ P(N − 1) + 1
Where R is total number of resources,
P is the number of processes, and
N is the max need for each resource.
```

Consider a long-lived TCP session with an end-to-end bandwidth of 1 Gbps (= 109 bits-per-
second). The session starts with a sequence number of 1234. The minimum time (in seconds,
rounded to the closest integer) before this sequence number can be used again is _______.
```

Solution: 34

The question asked is to find wrap around time

Consider a matrix P whose only eigenvectors are the multiples of
[1
4]

Consider the following statements.
(I) P does not have an inverse
(II) P has a repeated eigenvalue
(III) P cannot be diagonalized
Which one of the following options is correct?
(A) Only I and III are necessarily true (B) Only II is necessarily true
(C) Only I and II are necessarily true (D) Only II and III are necessarily true
```

Solution: (D)

- Since the eigen vectors are multiples of the matrix, the eigen vectors are dependent.
- Each is the linear combination of other
- since dependent, no distinct eigen values
- matrix with repeated eigen values cannot be diagonalizable
