Which one of the following statements is FALSE?
(A) Context-free grammar can be used to specify both lexical and syntax rules.
(B) Type checking is done before parsing.
(C) High-level language programs can be translated to different Intermediate
Representations.
(D) Arguments to a function can be passed using the program stack.
```

Solution: (B)

Type checking is done at semantic analysis and parsing at syntax analysis. Syntax analysis comes before semantic.

```
The following are some events that occur after a device controller issues an interrupt while
process L is under execution.
(P) The processor pushes the process status of L onto the control stack.
(Q)The processor finishes the execution of the current instruction.
(R) The processor executes the interrupt service routine.
(S) The processor pops the process status of L from the control stack.
(T) The processor loads the new PC value based on the interrupt.
Which one of the following is the correct order in which the events above occur?
(A) QPTRS (B) PTRSQ (C) TRPQS (D) QTPRS
```

Solution: (A)

Remember: when interrupt occurs, first the processor finishes the current instruction.
